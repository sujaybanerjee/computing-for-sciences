# computing-for-sciences
This repository is from a Middlebury College computer science class and provided an introduction to the field of computer science geared toward students interested in mathematics and the natural sciences. 
We studied problem-solving approaches and computational techniques utilized in a variety of domains including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. 
We learned how to program in Python, how to extract information from large data sets, and how to utilize a variety of tools employed in scientific computation.
